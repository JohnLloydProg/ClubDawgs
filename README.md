## Things to Note:

ClubDawg supports file-sharing features, but please adhere to the following guidelines to ensure a smooth experience:

- **Required Folder Structure:** Ensure a `files` folder exists in the target folder. This is where uploaded files will be stored.
- **File Naming Requirements:** When uploading files, please avoid using spaces or special characters in file names.
